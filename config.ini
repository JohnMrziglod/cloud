[General]
; If all paths to your data have a base dir in common, you can set it here. I
; encourage changing only this path on other machines and keeping the file
; structure as recommended in the manual file.
basedir=/Users/jm.mac.mobil/Data/MSM68-2/
; Number of processes that should be used for processing the data. On old
; machines (or slow laptops) this should be smaller than 4 (rather 2). On
; mistral, you can set this up to 32 (depending how many jobs are running in
; the background).
processes=4
; The metadata usually comes from DShip dataset but maybe in future we want to
; have other sources for the environment variables (e.g. GPS and air
; temperature from Pinocchio itself).
metadata=DShip
; The lapse rate [K / km] that will be used to calculate the different cloud
; height levels.
; TODO: Instead of setting this to a constant, one could set this config value
; to a dataset which provides a lapse rate time series (e.g. from a
; radiosonde).
lapse_rate=-4
; The start and end date can also be set here. These values will be ignored if
; you set them directly as command line options.
start=2017-11-02
end=2017-11-11

[Dumbo]
; The path to the raw files from Dumbo (as ASCII format). These files must
; exist.
raw_files=Dumbo/ThermalCam/{year2}{month}{day}ASC/*.asc
; The path to which the raw files should be converted
nc_files=Dumbo/ThermalCam/netcdf/{year}/{month}/{day}/tm{year2}{month}{day}{hour}.nc
; The path where to put the cloud statistics
stats=Dumbo/cloud_stats/{year}/{month}/{day}/tm{hour}-{end_hour}.nc
; The path to a mask file (if you do not have a mask, just comment out the next
; line)

; The path to a logbook file (if you do not have one, just comment it out)
logbook=Dumbo/dumbo-MSM68-2-logbook.txt

[Pinocchio]
; The path to the original files from Pinocchio (as tar archive). These files
; must exist.
archive_files=Pinocchio/ThermalCam/t{year2}{month}{day}.tgz
; The relative path of the raw files in the archive
files_in_archive=tm{year2}{month}{day}{hour}{minute}{second}{millisecond}.jpg

[Ceilometer]

[DShip]
; The path to the DShip files (can also contain placeholders)

[Plots]
; The path to all plots, {plot} will be replaced by the plot type, e.g.
; 'overview' or 'comparison
files=plots/{plot}/{year}{month}{day}_{hour}{minute}-{end_year}{end_month}{end_day}_{end_hour}{end_minute}.png
; To avoid overcrowded overview plots with too many data points, you can set
; here an average time. The data points will be binned into these time
; intervals and the mean of them is plotted only. The next three parameters
; configure this time interval depending on the total plotting time:
;  - hourly_plots_average is used for plots of less than 24 hours
;  - daily_plots_average is used for plots of more than 24 hours but less than
;    7 days.
;  - weekly_plots_average is used for plots of more than 7 days
; Caution: T is the unit for minutes, M the unit for months.
hourly_plots_average=10T
daily_plots_average=1H
weekly_plots_average=3H
