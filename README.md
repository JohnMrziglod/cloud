# Cloud Toolbox
This toolbox can process cloud image data from the Pinocchio and Dumbo 
cameras and plot them with the data of other instruments from the 
Semi-Automated Cloud Imager System.

## Installation
Simply clone this branch to your local computer by using this command:

    git clone https://github.com/JohnMrziglod/cloud.git

Additionally, you will need the typhon package (a python module for atmospheric
physics):

    git clone ttps://github.com/atmtools/typhon.git
    cd typhon
    pip install --user --editable .
    
and you will need other python packages:
* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* Pillow
* netcdf4

You can install them via:

    ï»¿pip3 install --user numpy scipy pandas matplotlib netcdf4 Pillow
    
## Documentation
Please find further documentation in the [manual](manual/cloud-manual.pdf). A 
developer documentation can be generated by using
[sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/). Use these commands to build it 
on your computer:
```bash
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

Now you can open the file **build/html/index.html** with your favourite HTML
browser.


Every script has also a ```-h``` option that provides further documentation 
via the command line.
    
## Update
You can update the cloud toolkit (or typhon) by running this command in the 
'cloud' (or 'typhon') directory:

    git pull
    
## Usage
This cloud toolkit contains several scripts:
*   **processor.py**: Opens the raw files of the Pinocchio or Dumbo
thermal cam, converts them either to netcdf files and apply a 
image mask. Then calculates the cloud parameters (coverage, inhomogeneity,
etc.) from Pinocchio or Dumbo netCDF thermal cam images.
*   **monitor.py**: Displays the data from all selected sources and creates
plots.
